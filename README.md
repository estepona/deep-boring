Are you burned out? Are you working too hard? Perhaps you should take a moment to relax and empty your mind, and if you have any exciting, crazy, random, or boring ideas about anything besides work, we welcome you to write / draw / record those ideas here in hope that you get relaxed by writing it down and checking out other people's thoughts.
